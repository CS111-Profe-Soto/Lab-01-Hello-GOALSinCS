# Lab 01 - Hello GOALS in CS!

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate editing, running, and testing of a Java application in a GitHub Classroom lab

## Instructions
1. **Open Codespace**

Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button in the README to open the code editor. BE PATIENT! The Codespace takes about two minutes to build. Do not do anything within the Codespace as it may interfere with the build process.

Read this [VSCode Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started) to learn about the key features of VSCode/Codespaces.

2. **Investigate the code**

Open [Main.java](./Main.java) and look at the code. There is a lot of extra code for a
simple program, but today just notice that we have a `class` named `Main`, a method 
named `main` and a statement `System.out.println("Hello world.");`. Don't worry, you do not need to understand everything yet!

3. **Run the code**
 
Running or executing your code will allow you to see how it currently works. There are a number of ways to run a program in VS Code. I suggest that you run the program by clicking the play button on the top-right of the editor window and select **_Run Java_**. Another way to run the code is to right-click the file and select **_Run Java_**. 
   
The output will appear in the terminal window.

4. **Change the code**

**_To complete this lab_**, edit the code inside `System.out.println` so it says:

```
Hello, GOALS in CS!
```

Note, it must say the above **exactly** as shown. 

5. **Test the code**

   1. Click on the  Erlenmeyer flask (cone flask) on the Activity Bar (left-hand navigation menu), which opens the Test view in the Primary Side Bar.
   2. Select **_Run Test_** from the Test view by hovering over the test (**_Lab-01-Hello_GOALSinCS_**), which reveals a play button.
   3. If your code passes the test, a green checkmark will appear. If you see a red X, click on the expected message and investigate the differences.

6. **Repeat steps 4 and 5 until done**

7. **Commit and Push your code**

   1. Click on the Source Control icon (three interconnected circles) in the Activity Bar.
   2. Click on the plus sign next to the files you wish to commit.
   3. Enter a meaningful commit message.
   4. Click the Commit & Push button. This sends your code to the GitHub repo, where I will be able to see your work.
